/**
 * The failure of a run, in the reader's language.
 *
 * The backend's failure field carries two different things: stable
 * identifiers (`all_tasks_failed`) and text that is already a German
 * sentence (a task's own result summary). The surface used to render
 * whichever arrived, so a user could be told "all_tasks_failed" — a
 * word from inside the machine, with no hint of what it meant or what
 * had still succeeded.
 *
 * Mapping is by code, and anything unknown passes through UNCHANGED.
 * A failure the UI cannot name is still a failure the user must see:
 * swallowing it, or replacing it with a generic apology, would hide the
 * one string that says what went wrong.
