/**
 * Chat-history server sync (M6a project-persistence tier).
 *
 * The chat analogue of useResearchRunApi (resume-on-mount) + useTemplateSync
 * (local<->server reconciliation), but persistence-only: it never calls a
 * model. The LLM submission path in ResearchDesk is untouched — this hook
 * is a PARALLEL layer that keeps the conversation record on the server in
 * step with the local reducer, exactly the way template sync runs beside
 * how rules are used.
 *
 * Three behaviours, all gated on the durable ``project_persistence``
 * capability AND ``serverSyncEnabled`` (automatic for an authenticated
 * cookie-session user — derived from the session in ResearchDesk; the import
 * button only sets it for the apikey / local-first tiers):
 *   1. Hydrate on mount: list groups + threads, merge their metadata into
 *      the reducer (server-pushed, never marks the project dirty). Messages
 *      load lazily, per thread, on open.
 *   2. Load-on-open: when a thread without loaded messages is selected,
 *      fetch one newest-first page and merge it in.
 *   3. Autosave: a debounced diff (via the shared syncCollection helper)
 *      pushes new/changed threads + their messages, new/changed groups, and
 *      DELETEs whatever vanished locally. Idempotent server upserts make a
 *      retry or a coalesced burst safe.
 *
 * It does NOT own the import button: the explicit opt-in push is the
 * project-level useProjectServerImport (which pushes chat AND editor in one
 * flow). This hook only hydrates + autosaves once the project is opted in
 * (syncActive), seeding its synced fingerprint to WHAT THE SERVER HOLDS so a
 * local-newer entity is pushed up rather than stranded.
