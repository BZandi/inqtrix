 * the poll that notices it finished — backing off immediately would add
 * seconds of spinner to deletions that are already done. Only an
 * operation that has proven it will not finish in that window gets a
 * calmer cadence, and that is exactly the operation which may run until
 * the server's dispatch timeout expires it. Shared by the session and
