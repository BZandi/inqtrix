/**
 * Owns the reset+hydrate lifecycle of a PROJECT-SCOPED server-sync hook, keyed
 * on the project identity rather than on the ``syncActive`` boolean alone.
 *
 * The bug this exists to prevent: the project-scoped persistence hooks (chat,
 * editor, assets, vector-index) seed a ``synced`` fingerprint map from the
 * server on hydrate and, on autosave, DELETE whatever is in ``synced`` but no
 * longer present locally. If the hook only re-armed on ``syncActive`` going
 * false, switching to a DIFFERENT project that is also server-synced (so
 * ``syncActive`` stays true) would leave the PRIOR project's fingerprints in
 * ``synced`` -- and the next autosave would delete that project's rows on the
 * server. Re-keying the lifecycle on a project-identity change forces each
 * project to re-hydrate from its OWN server state, turning a silent
 * cross-project deletion into a safe merge.
 *
 * One effect (not two) so the ordering is explicit and cannot be broken by
 * reordering: ``reset`` always runs before ``hydrate``, and the previous
 * identity's in-flight hydrate is cancelled (via cleanup) before the next one
 * begins. Account-scoped hooks (preferences) and server-authoritative syncs
 * (templates) deliberately do NOT use this -- they are not project-scoped and
 * have no local-wins delete path.
