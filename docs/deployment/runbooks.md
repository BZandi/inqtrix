# Runbooks — operate the Stack-mode deployment

> Files: `deploy/compose/compose.stack.yaml`

## Scope

Day-to-day lifecycle commands for the Stack mode compose stack: start, stop, restart, update, backup, restore, reset. Set up the stack first with [Stack quickstart](../getting-started/stack-quickstart.md).

Raw Compose is the canonical interface. The following temporary shell function
only keeps the examples readable; it contains the full contract and stores no
state:

```bash
inqtrix_compose() {
  docker compose \
    -f deploy/compose/compose.stack.yaml \
    --env-file deploy/.env.stack.secrets \
    --env-file deploy/.env.stack \
    "$@"
}
```

Replace `docker` with `podman` when required. For a named setup, replace both
env paths together and make their `INQTRIX_ENV_FILE` /
`INQTRIX_SECRETS_FILE` pointers match. The optional `inqtrix-deploy` CLI emits
this same Compose argv; it does not maintain another config or infer a cloud
provider.

Volumes are project-prefixed because the compose project is named `inqtrix`: `inqtrix_pgdata`, `inqtrix_objectstore`, `inqtrix_qdrant_storage`, `inqtrix_valkey_data`, `inqtrix_seaweedfs_data` (and `inqtrix_dex_data` with the `oidc` profile).

## Start

```bash
# Default stack: postgres + migrate + api + web
inqtrix_compose up -d --build

# With optional profiles (mix as needed)
inqtrix_compose --profile knowledge --profile workers up -d --build

# Live editor collaboration (requires matching env settings and cookie auth)
inqtrix_compose --profile collaboration up -d --build

# A named setup: pass the entire pair
docker compose -f deploy/compose/compose.stack.yaml \
  --env-file deploy/.env.stack.secrets.azure \
  --env-file deploy/.env.stack.azure \
  up -d --build
```

Optional CLI, with the environment selected explicitly:

```bash
# uv
uv run inqtrix-deploy \
  --engine docker \
  --secrets-file deploy/.env.stack.secrets.azure \
  --env-file deploy/.env.stack.azure \
  up --build --detach

# Standard Python/pip
python -m pip install -e .
python -m inqtrix.deploy \
  --engine docker \
  --secrets-file deploy/.env.stack.secrets.azure \
  --env-file deploy/.env.stack.azure \
  up --build --detach
```

PgBouncer remains opt-in. It starts only when the operator supplies
`--profile pgbouncer` and changes the visible runtime DSN to the
`pgbouncer:6432` form. Neither raw Compose nor the CLI activates it
automatically.

## Status & logs

```bash
inqtrix_compose ps                       # wait for healthy
inqtrix_compose logs -f api              # startup/config errors
inqtrix_compose logs migrate             # one-shot migration output
inqtrix_compose logs -f collaboration    # fencing/readiness/persistence
```

The CLI equivalents address the same project and pair:

```bash
inqtrix-deploy status
inqtrix-deploy logs api --follow --tail 200
```

## Stop / restart

```bash
inqtrix_compose down
inqtrix_compose restart api web
inqtrix_compose restart api collaboration web
```

Equivalent optional CLI:

```bash
inqtrix-deploy down
inqtrix-deploy restart api web
```

## Update

Pull the new code, then choose the update path that matches the configured
migration authority. Every installed-schema revision change requires the same
maintenance boundary, including bundled/`auto` and dedicated `bypass`: build
the new images, record active profiles, stop ingress plus API, worker,
Collaboration and all poolers, run the one-shot migration with
`INQTRIX_MIGRATION_SERVICES_QUIESCED=true`, verify head, then recreate only the
recorded workloads. The exact raw-Compose sequence is documented in
[Database migrations](database-migrations.md).

Normal Compose orchestration remains valid for a fresh install or a restart
whose database is already at the packaged head:

```bash
git pull
inqtrix_compose up -d --build

# Preserve active profiles in the same orchestrated update
inqtrix_compose --profile collaboration up -d --build
```

Managed PostgreSQL `owner` mode may use the guarded CLI operation; do not run
`compose up` first:

```bash
git pull
inqtrix-deploy \
  --external-db \
  --migration-env-file deploy/.env.migrate.secrets.azure \
  --secrets-file deploy/.env.stack.secrets.azure \
  --env-file deploy/.env.stack.azure \
  owner-upgrade --confirm-project inqtrix
```

The command builds the new images before draining active database clients,
runs the one-shot migration, then rolls the previously active API, worker,
Collaboration and web services to those images. A failure before the migration
attempt restores old containers; an interrupted or failed attempt leaves all
database clients stopped because its commit state is not safe to infer from a
CLI exit code. Verify the job and database revision before recovery. The exact
manual Compose sequence is documented as the canonical counterpart in
[Database migrations](database-migrations.md).

Do not run `inqtrix-migrate` while any workload or pooler session remains.
Managed PostgreSQL uses a separate migration env file and explicit RLS mode.
See [Database migrations](database-migrations.md). A direct command is allowed
only inside the documented maintenance window after a verified backup and full
database-client drain.

## Rotate the bundled PostgreSQL password

Changing `INQTRIX_PG_PASSWORD` in a file does not alter an initialized
PostgreSQL role. Generate a URL-safe value, stage it in the selected mode-`0600`
secret file, then let the guarded operation quiesce clients, apply `ALTER ROLE`
over stdin, and recreate the affected services:

```bash
inqtrix-deploy \
  --engine docker \
  --secrets-file deploy/.env.stack.secrets.azure \
  --env-file deploy/.env.stack.azure \
  db rotate-password --confirm-project inqtrix
```

The value is read only from the selected secret file. It is not accepted as a
CLI argument and is never printed. The visible DSN must continue to reference
`${INQTRIX_PG_PASSWORD}`. This operation deliberately rejects external
databases; use the provider's rotation procedure there.

The raw administrative counterpart is intentionally interactive so the new
password is not exposed in process arguments. First record exactly which
database clients are running; keep this shell and its captured positional
arguments until recovery is complete:

```bash
set -- $(
  inqtrix_compose ps --services --filter status=running |
    awk '/^(api|worker|collaboration|pgbouncer)$/'
)
printf 'Database clients to restore: %s\n' "$*"
if [ "$#" -gt 0 ]; then
  inqtrix_compose stop "$@"
fi
inqtrix_compose exec postgres psql -U inqtrix -d inqtrix
```

At the `psql` prompt run `\password inqtrix`, enter the exact staged value
twice, then `\q`. Recreate PostgreSQL and exactly the clients captured above:

```bash
inqtrix_compose up -d --wait --no-deps --force-recreate postgres
if [ "$#" -gt 0 ]; then
  inqtrix_compose up -d --wait --no-deps --force-recreate "$@"
fi
```

This deliberately does not infer profiles or start an optional worker,
Collaboration service, or PgBouncer that was inactive. Verify health and the
selected runtime DSN before reopening traffic.

## Local development (changing the code)

The Stack-mode images serve a **built** bundle — editing source does **not** hot-reload. After a code change, rebuild the affected image:

```bash
inqtrix_compose up -d --build web    # after a frontend change
inqtrix_compose up -d --build api    # after a backend change
```

For active development with **hot reload**, do not use the Stack-mode images. Run the frontend dev server (and optionally the backend) on the host:

```bash
# 1. Backing services + API only (Postgres + migrate + API, no web container):
inqtrix_compose up -d postgres migrate api

# 2. Frontend with hot reload (Vite, http://127.0.0.1:5173, proxies /api /v1 /health to the API):
npm run ui:dev
```

Edit files under `apps/research-desk/` and the browser updates instantly. To
also iterate on the **backend** with a fast restart, run it on the host instead
of the `api` container against the same Postgres:

```bash
# uv installation:
uv run python -m inqtrix

# or after `python -m pip install -e .` in an active venv:
python -m inqtrix
```

See the manual/host setup in
[Platform components](../getting-started/platform-components.md#manual--host-platform-framework-mode)
and the UI paths in
[First research run](../getting-started/first-research-run.md). Point the Vite
proxy at a non-default backend with `VITE_INQTRIX_API_BASE_URL`.

## Backup

Capture **both** the Postgres database and the object-store volume - uploaded blobs live outside Postgres. PostgreSQL already contains every collaboration update, snapshot, projection, lease, and decision row; the Node service has no separate volume to back up.

```bash
# Postgres dump
inqtrix_compose exec -T postgres pg_dump -U inqtrix inqtrix > backup-$(date +%F).sql

# Object-store volume (local backend)
docker run --rm -v inqtrix_objectstore:/data -v "$PWD:/out" \
  docker.io/library/busybox tar czf /out/objectstore-$(date +%F).tgz -C /data .
```

If you run `--profile knowledge`, also snapshot the Qdrant volume (`inqtrix_qdrant_storage`) the same way; re-ingestion can rebuild it, so it is optional.

## Restore

For a collaboration-enabled deployment, stop the API and Node writer before
restore. Restore a matching application/schema version, then start FastAPI
before exactly one collaboration instance. Node reconstructs each room from
the verified snapshot plus update tail; never reconstruct it from Markdown
alone. See [Deploy editor collaboration](editor-collaboration.md#backup-and-restore).

```bash
# Postgres (into a fresh, migrated database)
cat backup-YYYY-MM-DD.sql | inqtrix_compose exec -T postgres psql -U inqtrix inqtrix

# Object-store volume
docker run --rm -v inqtrix_objectstore:/data -v "$PWD:/in" \
  docker.io/library/busybox sh -c "cd /data && tar xzf /in/objectstore-YYYY-MM-DD.tgz"
```

## Reset (destroy all data)

```bash
inqtrix_compose down --volumes        # removes containers AND named volumes
```

The CLI requires its explicit destructive confirmation for the same operation.
Re-running `up -d --build` then re-migrates a clean database.

## Collaboration kill switch

Set `INQTRIX_COLLABORATION_ENABLED=false`, restart FastAPI, and then stop the
collaboration service. Legacy Markdown editing continues. Existing
collaboration documents retain their binary PostgreSQL state and expose only
the last saved Markdown projection read-only; the switch does not convert or
delete them.
