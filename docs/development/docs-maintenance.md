# Docs maintenance

## Scope

How to keep `docs/**` honest over time. The repository uses plain GitHub-rendered Markdown today (no MkDocs, no Sphinx); the conventions below keep structure and cross-links consistent and make a future migration to MkDocs-Material a mechanical move.

## Conventions per page

Every page under `docs/**`:

1. Starts with an H1 title matching the filename (title-cased, spaces allowed).
2. Has a `## Scope` section as the first sub-heading explaining what the page does and does not cover.
3. Uses relative links for internal cross-refs (`[Agent config](../configuration/agent-config.md)`), never absolute URLs to GitHub.
4. Ends with a `## Related docs` block listing 2–4 peer pages with 0–1 sentence teasers.
5. Mermaid diagrams use only the subset that renders on GitHub: `flowchart`, `stateDiagram`, `sequenceDiagram`. Avoid `timeline`, `mindmap`, `C4Context` until confirmed.
6. Code examples use triple backticks with an explicit language tag (`python`, `bash`, `yaml`, `json`, `dotenv`).
7. English-only prose. German strings only inside quoted demo questions or prompt snippets, matching the repository convention.
8. No Mermaid diagram stands alone. The paragraph before it states the reader question it answers; the paragraph after it names the important transition(s) and clarifies which blocks are code vs data.
9. New terms are defined on first use. Avoid shorthand such as "ledger", "bundle", "contract", or "strategy" unless the local page says what object it refers to and where it lives.
10. Technical identifiers in prose include their data kind and type on first use within a section when the kind is not obvious from the sentence.

## Current-state versioned content

Versioned documentation describes the supported present contract. Do not cite
private plans, priority labels, internal decision ids, task logs, branches,
commits, incidents, or the dates on which internal decisions and fixes were
made. State the current rationale and observable behaviour directly.

Functional protocol versions, schema revisions, dependency or image versions,
source provenance, retention examples, and deterministic temporal fixtures
remain valid when the described behaviour depends on them. Runtime verification
reports and their timestamps are local artifacts; public evidence identifies
the Inqtrix version under test.

`README.md` and `docs/**` are the public documentation hierarchy.
[`apps/research-desk/DESIGN.md`](../../apps/research-desk/DESIGN.md) is the
intentional code-adjacent exception: it is the versioned design-language
contract for Research Desk tokens, motion, primitives, and accessibility
behaviour. Private agent memory and editor-specific rule files are never a
public source of truth.

## Reader depth (configuration, APIs, and heuristics)

Structure alone (Scope, Related docs, tables) is not enough when a reader must predict runtime behaviour.

For pages under `docs/configuration/`, provider setup pages, HTTP deployment pages, and `docs/scoring-and-stopping/`:

1. **Prefer an explicit behaviour column** in tables (for example **Effect** or **Behaviour**) that states what changes for the user or for a single run when the value is set, not only the literal meaning of the name.
2. **Add at least one copy-paste example** (Python, `dotenv`, `yaml`, or `bash`) when the interaction is non-obvious: precedence chains, per-request overrides, provider auto-creation, or anything that touches more than one subsystem.
3. **Link to runnable scripts** under `examples/` when they already demonstrate the stack; one sentence of context is enough.
4. **Use small diagrams or log excerpts** when control flow or iteration-log fields matter (see [`../scoring-and-stopping/confidence.md`](../scoring-and-stopping/confidence.md) and [`../reference/worked-example.md`](../reference/worked-example.md) as references).

Agent-facing coding rules for docstrings and Pydantic fields remain in [`coding-standards.md`](coding-standards.md); this section is the bar for **user-facing Markdown** in `docs/**`.

## Diagrams, schemas, and LLM-call documentation

Architecture diagrams should be readable by someone who has not opened the
source code yet. Use the legend from
[`../architecture/overview.md`](../architecture/overview.md#how-to-read-the-diagrams):

| Prefix / shape | Use for |
|---|---|
| `fn ...` | Python function, method, node, or helper. |
| `data ...` / cylinder-style node | `AgentState` field, ledger, Pydantic model, or stored view. |
| `strategy ...` / double-bracket node | Replaceable strategy or policy object. |
| `provider ...` / hexagon-style node | External LLM/search backend or provider interface. |
| `LLM call: ...` | A concrete model call, including strategy-owned helper calls. |
| `router ...` / diamond | Control-flow decision. |

When documenting a new or changed LLM call, include:

- node/stage that makes the call,
- provider method (`complete`, `complete_with_metadata`, `complete_structured`, or strategy-owned call),
- model role (`classify`, `claim extraction`, `evaluate`, `reasoning`),
- prompt origin (`nodes.py`, `prompts.py`, strategy prompt, provider helper),
- expected output shape and parser,
- fallback marker or visible degradation path.

When documenting a new state/evidence structure, include either a compact schema
or a small example. Also state whether the object is primary truth, derived
view, prompt-facing view, audit view, or public projection.

## Identifier kind and type notation

Use normal Python/Pydantic vocabulary rather than inventing a custom mini-syntax.
The goal is to remove ambiguity without making prose noisy.

Preferred first-use forms:

| Identifier shape | First-use annotation |
|---|---|
| `state["iteration_logs"]` | `state["iteration_logs"]` (`AgentState` key, `list[dict[str, Any]]`) |
| `ResearchResult` | `ResearchResult` (`Pydantic BaseModel`) |
| `ProviderContext` | `ProviderContext` (`@dataclass`) |
| `LLMProvider` | `LLMProvider` (`ABC`) |
| `AgentSettings.skip_search` | `AgentSettings.skip_search` (`bool`, env alias `SKIP_SEARCH`) |
| `body["agent_overrides"]` | `body["agent_overrides"]` (`HTTP JSON object`) |

Do not annotate every repeated mention. For data-heavy sections, prefer a table
with `Identifier`, `Kind`, `Type`, `Source of truth`, and `Role` columns instead
of long parenthetical prose.

## Adding a new page

1. Pick the closest existing subdirectory (`architecture/`, `providers/`, `configuration/`, `deployment/`, `observability/`, `scoring-and-stopping/`, `development/`, `getting-started/`, `reference/`).
2. Write the page following the conventions above.
3. Add the new page to the `Related docs` blocks of the pages that should link to it.
4. Update [`../README.md`](../README.md) when the page is a top-level task entry.
5. Update the root [`../../README.md`](../../README.md) when the page changes a major entry path.
6. Run a local link check (see below).

## Link check

Use [`lychee`](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee) for a fast offline link check. There is no committed CI workflow for link-checking today; the repository's CI configuration is maintainer-owned, and this snippet is the recommended starting point when the project adopts one:

```bash
# Local check
lychee --no-progress --include-fragments \
    README.md 'docs/**/*.md' 'examples/**/README.md'
```

```yaml
# Recommended GitHub Actions snippet (not yet committed)
name: docs
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'README.md'
      - 'docs/**'
      - 'examples/**/README.md'
jobs:
  link-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: lycheeverse/lychee-action@v2
        with:
          args: --no-progress --include-fragments README.md docs/**/*.md examples/**/README.md
          fail: true
```

Alternative tools: `markdown-link-check` (Node, widely used, deprecated community action has forks), `linkinator` (Node, dual CLI/module). `lychee` is recommended for speed on CI.

## Mermaid syntax constraints

Stick to the following subset — all four were verified to render on GitHub at the time of writing:

- Node IDs: camelCase or snake_case. No spaces (`UserService` OK, `User Service` not).
- Edge labels with special characters: wrap in quotes (`A -->|"O(1) lookup"| B`).
- Node labels with `(`, `)`, `:`: wrap in double quotes (`A["Process (main)"]`).
- Avoid reserved keywords as node IDs (`end`, `graph`, `subgraph`, `flowchart`).
- Subgraph headers always specify an ID plus a bracketed label: `subgraph gb [Group B]`.
- Do not use explicit colours or `classDef fill:#...` — they render badly in dark mode.
- Do not use `click` events; GitHub strips them.

## Keeping docs in sync with code

Whenever a code change alters public behaviour, update the matching `docs/**` page in the same PR:

| Code area | Matching docs page(s) |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| `src/inqtrix/providers/<x>.py` | `docs/providers/<x>.md` |
| `src/inqtrix/providers/__init__.py` (env provider selector), `ProviderSettings` in `settings.py` | `docs/getting-started/provider-recipes.md`, `docs/providers/overview.md`, `docs/configuration/settings-and-env.md` |

| editor collaboration (`packages/editor-schema/**`, `apps/collaboration-server/**`, `src/inqtrix/{project,services,storage,server}/**collaboration**`, editor share/patch changes, and `apps/research-desk/src/features/editor/**`) | `docs/architecture/editor-collaboration.md` (truth, flow, contracts), `docs/how-to/collaborate-on-editor-documents.md` (roles and UX), `docs/deployment/editor-collaboration.md` (topology and operations), `docs/configuration/settings-and-env.md` (every variable), and `docs/development/testing-strategy.md` (cross-runtime gates) |
| `deploy/compose/compose.dev-ports.yaml` | `docs/development/local-infrastructure.md`, `docs/getting-started/platform-components.md` (manual/host section), and, for Dex/OIDC ports, `docs/deployment/auth-modes.md` |

| `deploy/helm/inqtrix/**` (Helm chart, values, templates) | `docs/deployment/kubernetes.md`, `docs/deployment/deployment-modes.md`; migration role/Secret changes additionally `docs/deployment/database-migrations.md`, object-store identity/CA changes `docs/deployment/object-storage.md`, collaboration values/templates `docs/deployment/editor-collaboration.md` |
| `src/inqtrix/agent.py` public API | `docs/architecture/public-api.md`, `docs/architecture/overview.md` |

| `apps/research-desk/**`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json` | `docs/deployment/react-ui.md` and, when the run-event contract changes, `docs/observability/run-events.md`; when a frontend dependency is added or changed, also regenerate `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`/`.json` per [`release-process.md`](release-process.md) (step 7) |
| `apps/research-desk/src/styles/globals.css`, `apps/research-desk/src/motion/**`, `apps/research-desk/src/components/ui/**`, visual role or primitive changes | `apps/research-desk/DESIGN.md`; public user-visible behaviour additionally updates the relevant page under `docs/**` |

**Env-var completeness rule.** [`settings-and-env.md`](../configuration/settings-and-env.md) is the single source of truth for environment variables and must list **every** variable the code reads: every `Field(alias=...)` / `validation_alias` in `settings.py` (a new `*Settings` class gets its own block), and every `os.getenv` / `os.environ` read in the server/worker bootstrap, scripts, and tests (the last under the development/test-only section). A variable may appear in a table row or in a "Further tuning" prose line, but it must appear under its exact name so the page stays greppable. The committed `.env.example` / `deploy/.env.stack.example` templates are curated starters, not the reference; keep them free of variables that no longer exist in code. Deep-dive pages (provider recipes, auth modes, logging) may show usage but link here for the definition.

Maintainer notes are not a substitute for the public docs. Private working
memory may retain local deliberation, while `docs/**` describes the current
behaviour a user relies on.

Public docs must stand on their own. Do not reference private memory paths, internal decision ids, or internal issue numbers from user-facing pages; rewrite the behaviour directly or link to another public `docs/**` page.

When a pull request changes public behaviour (`settings.py`, `AgentConfig`, HTTP routes, provider constructors, stop heuristics), update the matching `docs/**` page **in the same PR** and apply the **Reader depth** rules above for any new or materially changed knob.

## Legacy docs migration

When a long-form legacy document is split into the current tree, keep a small migration matrix in [`../README.md`](../README.md) with these columns:

| Legacy section | Current home | Status |
|----------------|--------------|--------|
| `Quick Start / explicit providers` | `deployment/library-mode.md` | Updated to current imports and constructor signatures. |
| `HTTP Streaming` | `deployment/webserver-mode.md` | Updated to current SSE body and overrides. |
| `Custom Search Provider` | `providers/writing-a-custom-provider.md` | Updated with `search_model` and capability metadata. |

Before copying a legacy snippet, check imports, constructor signatures, enum names, env vars, and whether the feature still exists in code. Code wins over old prose.
