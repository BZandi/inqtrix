"""Interactive Anthropic + Perplexity research chat (terminal REPL).

Architecture
------------
Same provider stack as the sibling
[``anthropic_perplexity.py``](anthropic_perplexity.py):

1. **Anthropic Messages API** via ``AnthropicLLM`` (native ``urllib``).
2. **Perplexity Sonar API** via ``PerplexitySearch`` (OpenAI SDK pointed
   at ``https://api.perplexity.ai``).

The only difference is the run mode: instead of a single hard-coded
``QUESTION``, this script opens a chat-style loop in the terminal.
You type a question, watch the research stream, read the rendered
Markdown answer, and ask a follow-up — similar to Ollama's CLI.

Follow-up handling
------------------
Conversation history is fed into the next turn via the ``history``
argument of :meth:`inqtrix.ResearchAgent.stream`. Each turn re-runs
the full classify/plan/search/evaluate/answer graph, but the prior
Q&A is included in the classify prompt so phrases like "this", "those
states", or "the previous topic" resolve correctly.

This is intentionally simpler than full session-state reuse
(``prev_session``), which would require digging into the agent's raw
state dict. The trade-off: every follow-up does fresh research,
which is slightly more expensive than reusing prior evidence — but
the benefit is zero changes to inqtrix internals. Everything new
lives in this single file.

History is capped at the last :data:`MAX_HISTORY_TURNS` Q&A pairs to
keep the classify prompt bounded. Use ``/clear`` to reset on demand.

Slash commands
--------------
- ``/help``, ``/?`` — show available commands
- ``/clear``        — reset conversation history (next question is fresh)
- ``/exit``, ``/bye``, ``/quit`` — leave the chat loop
- ``Ctrl+C`` during a run — cancel the current turn, keep the loop
- ``Ctrl+C`` at empty prompt — exit
- ``Ctrl+D`` — exit

Required environment variables (in ``.env`` or process env):

- ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``
- ``PERPLEXITY_API_KEY``

Optional (file logging, same as the sibling):

- ``INQTRIX_LOG_ENABLED``, ``INQTRIX_LOG_LEVEL``, ``INQTRIX_LOG_CONSOLE``

Recommendation: leave ``INQTRIX_LOG_CONSOLE`` unset (the default).
WARNING+ records on stderr can otherwise collide with the live
progress region and visually fragment the rendered frame. File-only
logging via ``INQTRIX_LOG_ENABLED=true`` is safe.
