class ResearchAgent:
    """Iterative research agent with pluggable providers and strategies.

    The agent compiles a LangGraph state machine
    (classify → plan → search ↔ evaluate → answer) and orchestrates one
    research run per :meth:`research` or :meth:`stream` call. Providers
    and strategies are pulled from the bound :class:`AgentConfig`; any
    fields left as ``None`` are auto-created from environment variables
    on first use and then cached for the lifetime of the instance.

    The instance is **safe to reuse** across many sequential runs (the
    compiled graph and lazy-created providers are cached). It is **not
    thread-safe** for concurrent runs against the same instance —
    create one instance per worker, or wrap calls in a lock if you must
    share. Streaming via :meth:`stream` uses an internal background
    thread to drain progress; that does not make the rest of the API
    concurrent-safe.

    Attributes:
        config: The bound :class:`AgentConfig`. Read-only after
            construction; mutate by building a new agent instead.
        providers: The lazily-created :class:`ProviderContext`. Auto-
            created on first :meth:`research` / :meth:`stream` call;
            access this property to force eager creation.
        strategies: The lazily-created :class:`StrategyContext`. Same
            lifecycle as ``providers``.

    Example:
        >>> from inqtrix import ResearchAgent
        >>> agent = ResearchAgent()
        >>> result = agent.research("Was ist der Stand der GKV-Reform?")
        >>> print(result.answer)

        Provider and strategy auto-creation is deferred until the first

        agent never touches the network or environment.

        Args:
            config: Optional :class:`AgentConfig`. When ``None`` (the
                default), an empty ``AgentConfig`` is used and every
