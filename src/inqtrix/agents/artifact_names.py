The name is DISPLAY AND ADDRESS, never a key: identity stays the
``artifact_id``, the name is ``slug(title) + ".md"`` made unique per
session with a ``-2`` suffix in created order. The slug is a byte-exact
port of the frontend's NFKD slug (``slugLabel``-family), pinned by the
shared parity fixture ``tests/fixtures/artifact_name_parity.json`` that
both languages consume — change one side only via the fixture.
