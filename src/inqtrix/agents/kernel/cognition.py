"""Kernel cognition layer — the loop's own fast-tier self-judgment.

The ONE home for cheap metacognitive LLM calls the kernel makes about
its own progress. Today that is the adaptive
evidence-sufficiency judgement behind
:class:`~inqtrix.agents.kernel.middleware.KernelSufficiencyMiddleware`;
a later judge-before-delegate check joins HERE instead of growing a
second judge path.

Deliberately NOT here: a server-side web-query rewrite ("Weg B"). The
HITL gate publishes the model's tool args verbatim and the tool body
executes exactly those args (published == enforced) — rewriting the
query after the gate would search something the user never approved.
Query quality is steered in the prompt instead (``_KERNEL_TOOL_
DISCIPLINE`` and the ``web_instant`` docstring). Revisit only as a
``before_model`` step that runs BEFORE the gate, never inside a tool
body.
