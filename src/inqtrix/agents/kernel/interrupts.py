"""Kernel interrupt translation.

Two interrupt ORIGINS, one outer machinery (park -> control rows ->
decide/answer -> wake -> resume-from-rows, rule R5):

* **A — the ``ask_user`` tool** raises ``interrupt()`` itself after an
  idempotent clarification create. Its payload is our own
  ``{"kind": "clarification", "id": ...}`` and the resume value is
  delivered as the tool-internal ``interrupt()`` return.
* **B — deepagents HITL middleware** (``interrupt_on`` policy gates)
  raises payloads shaped ``{"action_requests": [...], "review_configs":
  [...]}`` and resumes through ``{"decisions": [...]}`` (shape frozen by
  the harness contract tests).

:func:`translate_kernel_interrupt` is the ONE discriminator between the
two — the algorithm never pattern-matches payloads inline.
