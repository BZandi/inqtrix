"""Kernel tool-gating policy per autonomy mode.

THE one mapping from the run's autonomy to the deepagents
``interrupt_on`` configuration — the algorithm compiles one graph
variant per policy (interrupt_on is compile-time, the policy is fixed
per run), tools never check permissions themselves.

Wire vocabulary stays the E16 three-mode set (strict/balanced/
autonomous); the UI presents Standard(balanced)/Auto(autonomous). The
plan-table semantics:

======================  ==================================  ==========
Tool                    Standard (balanced)                 Auto
======================  ==================================  ==========
ask_user                free                                free
web_instant             GATED — query verbatim in args      free
search_project_...      gated only UN-scoped                free
read_project_document   free                                free
read_research_report    free (only ATTACHED reports)        free
======================  ==================================  ==========

``strict`` gates every capability tool (the enterprise mode: nothing
external or internal-broad runs unreviewed). Write-effect tools
(``propose_editor_patch``, M2 step 7) are ALWAYS gated in every mode —
they belong to :data:`ALWAYS_GATED_TOOLS`, not to a mode table.
Canvas reads and writes are gated only in ``strict``; Standard and Auto
keep the canvas itself as their review surface.

The config dicts are LangChain ``InterruptOnConfig`` TypedDicts (plain
dicts at runtime — no langchain import needed here). Allowed decisions
mirror our ``APPROVAL_DECISIONS`` (approve/edit/reject); ``respond``
stays unexposed.
