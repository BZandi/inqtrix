"""Canonicalization of plan collection references (name -> id).

THE one collection-reference rule for every plan that wants to execute
(Designprinzip 4): the M5 planner output and a user's edit decision both
run through :func:`resolve_plan_collections` BEFORE the shared validator
(:mod:`inqtrix.agents.plan_validation`) checks membership against the
caller-visible catalog. The duties are deliberately non-overlapping:

* this module rewrites resolvable NAME references to canonical ids —
  planners and humans naturally quote "EU-AI-Act", never ``kc_...`` —
  and reports ambiguity (two collections sharing a name cannot be
  resolved deterministically);
* unknown references stay untouched so the validator's
  ``allowed_collection_ids`` check reports them alongside every other
  violation in one repair round.

Retrieval itself keeps the strict E5 gate
(``assert_collections_visible``) as defense in depth; after this pass a
saved plan carries only canonical ids, so that gate passes instead of
surfacing a raw ``CollectionNotFound`` mid-run.

    Mutates *plan* in place — the caller exclusively owns the instance in
    both call sites (planner repair loop, approval-edit endpoint) and
    persists it only after the combined error list is empty.

    Per entry: an exact id match stays; a unique normalized name match
    becomes that id; an ambiguous name is reported; anything else is left
    untouched for the validator to flag as unknown. Duplicates collapsing
    onto the same id (name and id of one collection listed together) are
    deduplicated, order preserved.

        plan: Parsed plan whose task params are canonicalized in place.
        catalog: Caller-visible collections (empty means the caller sees
            none — every explicit reference will then fail validation).

    Returns:
