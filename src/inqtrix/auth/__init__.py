"""Identity layer: principal resolution behind a Baukasten provider seam.

Every HTTP request resolves to exactly one :class:`~inqtrix.auth.principal.Principal`
— including the legacy no-auth deployment (the anonymous principal) and
the static-API-key deployment (the ``__static__`` principal). Routers
and services therefore never branch on "is auth enabled"; they consume
a uniform principal object (Designprinzip 2/3).

Modules:

* :mod:`inqtrix.auth.principal` — ``Principal`` / ``UserContext``
  dataclasses, the ``AuthProvider`` ABC, the anonymous provider, and
  the ``AUTH_MODE`` resolution rule.
* :mod:`inqtrix.auth.api_key` — the static-Bearer-key provider that
  wraps the historical ``hmac.compare_digest`` gate byte-for-byte,
  plus the settings-to-provider bridge ``build_auth_provider``.
* :mod:`inqtrix.auth.permissions` — the authorization chokepoint:
  ordered roles/permissions, repository ports, and the
  ``AuthorizationService`` keeping workspace membership separate from
  owner-or-direct-share resource access (denials hidden as not-found,
  audited loudly).
* :mod:`inqtrix.auth.identity_memory` — the no-infrastructure
  identity backend implementing every permission-layer port.

OIDC (browser SSO via an external IdP) and personal access tokens
arrive as additional providers behind the same ABC.
