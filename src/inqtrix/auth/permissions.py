"""Permission chokepoint: workspace membership, shares, and visibility.

This module is the single authority for authorization decisions
(ADR-style commitment from the platform rebuild plan): routers and
services ask :class:`AuthorizationService`; nothing else combines
membership and direct-share facts. Postgres row-level security is a
coarse tenant defense layer underneath, never the fine-grained truth.

Two deliberate behavioural anchors:

* **Legacy principals are unscoped.** The ``anonymous`` and ``static``
  principals (open server / static Bearer key) predate multi-user
  operation; for them every visibility question resolves to "no
  filtering" so existing single-tenant deployments behave
  bit-for-bit. Scoping activates only for ``oidc_session``/``pat``
  principals.
* **Denied is indistinguishable from absent.** Failed access checks
  raise not-found errors, never 403 — resource existence is itself
  information (OWASP guidance; GitHub/Slack API behaviour). Every
  denial is still loudly visible to operators via ``log.warning`` and
  the audit sink (Designprinzip 1).
