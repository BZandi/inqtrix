"""Principal model, AuthProvider seam, and the AUTH_MODE resolution rule.

Design decisions (mirroring the platform rebuild plan):

* A request ALWAYS resolves to a :class:`Principal` — the legacy
  open-server deployment yields :data:`ANONYMOUS_PRINCIPAL`, the
  static-key deployment yields :data:`STATIC_PRINCIPAL`. Downstream
  code never holds ``Principal | None``.
* ``Principal`` carries single-valued identity facts only. Plural,
  membership-style facts (workspace ids, group ids) belong to
  :class:`UserContext`, which the permission layer resolves
  server-side — never from client-supplied headers.
* The active mode is decided once at startup by
  :func:`resolve_auth_mode` with an explicit-wins / infer-for-
  backwards-compat rule, and the decision is logged. Misconfiguration
  raises at startup instead of silently downgrading (Designprinzip 1).

            cannot participate in user-scoped sharing or persistence.
        kind: How the principal authenticated. Drives audit labelling
            and (later) per-kind policy; never used for silent
            behavioural branches.
        tenant_id: Tenant the principal belongs to. v1 deployments run
            one tenant per deployment, so this is the constant
            ``"default"`` until multi-tenant resolution lands; the
            field exists from day one because retrofitting it across
            every table and query later is far more expensive.
        role: Coarse role used by the permission layer. The legacy
            anonymous/static principals get ``"owner"`` so existing
            single-tenant deployments keep their unrestricted
            behaviour bit-for-bit once permission checks exist.
        scopes: Optional capability scopes (personal access tokens
            carry these). Empty means unscoped/full access for the
            principal's role.
        display_name: Optional human-readable name for UI/audit
            surfaces.
        email: Optional e-mail claim from the IdP; identity anchoring
            always uses ``user_id``, never e-mail or an IdP subject.
        session_id: Server-side session row id for ``oidc_session``
            principals, enabling targeted revocation.
        pat_id: Token row id for ``pat`` principals, enabling targeted
