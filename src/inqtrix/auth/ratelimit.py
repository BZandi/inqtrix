"""Login brute-force throttling for the password modes (local/ldap).

A small sliding-window-plus-lockout limiter keyed on ``(identifier,
source_ip)``: after too many FAILED attempts inside the window the key is
locked for a cooldown. The uniform-timing credential check already denies an
email-enumeration oracle; this caps the guess RATE once an email is known.

Constructor-First (Designprinzip 6): thresholds arrive as arguments and the
clock is injectable for tests. The default backend is process-local in-memory
— correct for a single-node deployment; a multi-replica deployment should add
per-IP throttling at the reverse proxy / WAF (documented in
docs/how-to/deploy-to-production.md), since the in-memory counters are not
shared across replicas. The limiter is a Protocol so a Redis-backed
implementation can drop in later without touching the routes.

    deployments add edge throttling) — so evicting a stale or oldest key never

    ``X-Forwarded-For`` is a chain each proxy APPENDS its own peer to; the
    left-most entries are whatever the original client sent and are therefore
    attacker-controlled. Reading the left-most hop (the historical behaviour)
    let a client mint a fresh throttle key per request by rotating a spoofed
    value, defeating the login lockout entirely. Both supported web adapters
    (the packaged Python gateway and the explicit nginx alternative) APPEND
    the real peer on the right and strip nothing, so the trustworthy value is
    the hop our own infrastructure wrote, counted from the right.

    Args:
        request: The incoming Starlette/FastAPI request.
        trusted_proxy_hops: Number of reverse proxies between the client and
            this server that append to ``X-Forwarded-For``. ``1`` (default)
            fits the single bundled proxy: the right-most hop is the real
            client and is not client-spoofable. ``0`` means the server is
            exposed directly with no trusted proxy — every forwarded header
            is ignored and only the socket peer is used. ``n`` trusts the
            right-most ``n`` hops as infrastructure and reads the client from
            ``chain[-n]``. Set it to EXACTLY the number of proxies in front:
            a value larger than the real chain lets a client backfill the
            gap and spoof again.

    Returns:
        The resolved client IP string, or ``"?"`` when no address is
        available. Used only as a throttle key, never for authorization, and
        the limiter is memory-bounded, so even a spoofed value at worst
        throttles the spoofer and is evicted; it is no amplification
