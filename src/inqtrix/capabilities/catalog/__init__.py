"""Capability catalog builders.

Each builder takes an already-wired application service (or provider)
and returns the :class:`~inqtrix.capabilities.contracts.CapabilityDefinition`
list it owns. The composition root calls only the builders whose service
is present — the same conditional-registration pattern as router
mounting, so a disabled surface contributes no capabilities.
