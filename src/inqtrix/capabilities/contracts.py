"""The capability contract: one shape consumed by three adapters.

A *capability* is a request/response service operation exposed to
agents (and later to MCP clients and thin REST routes) through one
uniform definition. Capabilities deliberately DO NOT contain business
logic — each wraps an existing application-service method and adds only
the typed envelope, the side-effect classification, and the injected
:class:`CapabilityContext`. They are distinct from
:class:`~inqtrix.core.algorithms.AlgorithmRegistry`, which stays the
sole registry for long-running graph engines; the capability layer
CALLS INTO services, it does not re-model algorithms.

The three fields that classify a capability — ``effect``,
``idempotent`` — map 1:1 onto the MCP tool-annotation vocabulary
(``readOnlyHint`` / ``destructiveHint`` / ``idempotentHint``), so the
later MCP adapter needs no second source of truth.
