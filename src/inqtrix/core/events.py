"""Event-sink contract shared by algorithms and the run store.

An event sink is the callable an algorithm uses to emit structured
progress events for one run. The shape matches the existing
``run_event_sink`` parameter of ``inqtrix.graph.run`` and the
``RunHandle.emit`` method of the in-memory run store, so wiring an
algorithm into the native ``/v1/runs`` surface is a pass-through.

A typed ``RunEvent`` model and a durable ``RunEventBus`` port join
this module when run persistence lands; until then the callable alias
is the honest, minimal contract.
