"""Query decomposition: split multi-aspect questions into sub-queries.

The deep-profile stage for the aggregation failure class: a question
like "Welche Pflichten gelten fuer Backups, Verschluesselung UND
Aufbewahrung?" scatters over several documents, and a single retrieval
lets the first aspect crowd the others out of the top-k. One fast-tier
LLM call splits such questions into 2-4 self-contained German
sub-queries; the caller retrieves each and interleaves the results so
EVERY aspect contributes candidates.

Decomposition does not REFORMULATE the question — that is the gate
rewrite's job (the single rewrite location). It only splits, which is
why it lives in its own module and stays independently testable and
switchable.

Failure policy (No Silent Fallbacks): an unparseable response yields
an EMPTY decomposition plus the loud ``_knowledge_decompose_fallback``
marker — the run proceeds single-query, visibly degraded, mirroring
the gate's fail-open contract.
