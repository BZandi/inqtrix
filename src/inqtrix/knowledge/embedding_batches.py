"""Token-budgeted slicing and paced submission of embedding requests.

One document historically reached the embedding provider as a single
request carrying every chunk. Large documents (hundreds of chunks,
~200k tokens) exceed a per-minute provider quota in one shot and can
therefore never succeed, no matter how often the job resumes. This
module splits the input into order-preserving slices under a character
budget and, when the provider rejects a slice with a rate limit, waits
visibly (honouring ``Retry-After``) before submitting that same slice
again — bounded, cancellable, never silent. A 429 rejects the request
at the gate without processing it, so resubmission cannot double-embed
anything.

Ordering is the load-bearing invariant: the caller pairs vector ``i``
with chunk ``i`` positionally. Slices are submitted strictly
sequentially and concatenated in plan order, so no completion-order
race can reorder results; within one slice the provider's own
index-sort and count check apply (``_OpenAISDKEmbeddings._embed``).
