"""Sufficiency gate: one fast-tier LLM call judging retrieved evidence.

The gate is the honesty mechanism of ``mode=knowledge``: instead of
always answering from the top-k (which fabricates confidence on
unanswerable questions), one small LLM call judges whether the
evidence carries the question — and may propose EXACTLY ONE rewritten
query for a second retrieval pass. Insufficient evidence after that
produces the honest "no relevant content" answer.

Failure policy (No Silent Fallbacks): an unparseable gate response
falls OPEN to "sufficient" — a cited answer from real evidence beats a
crashed request — but always with the loud ``_knowledge_gate_fallback``
marker in the log and the iteration state, never invisibly.

        sufficient: Whether the evidence carries the question.

            ``"partial"``, or ``"none"``. The refusal decision keys on
            THIS, not on ``sufficient``: live evaluation showed the
            binary verdict refusing answerable multi-aspect questions
            wholesale (DORA tier, false_refusal 0.56) although the
            answer prompt already discloses gaps explicitly. Only
            ``"none"`` (no relevant evidence at all) justifies the
            honest refusal; ``"partial"`` answers with the gaps named.
            A clean parse without the field maps ``sufficient`` to
            ``full``/``none`` (older-style responses stay safe).
        rewritten_query: At most one alternative query for the second
            retrieval pass; ``None`` when the model offered none.
        reason: The model's one-sentence justification (markers/logs).
        marker: ``_knowledge_gate_parsed`` for a clean parse,
            ``_knowledge_gate_fallback`` when the response was
            unparseable and the gate failed open.
