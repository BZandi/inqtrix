"""Retrieval profiles: per-request presets over the knowledge pipeline.

A profile bundles the existing pipeline stages (rerank, sufficiency
gate, vocabulary-bridge rewrite, query decomposition, report-style
synthesis) into one user-facing choice, so a request selects ONE name
instead of five switches. Two levels govern what actually runs:

* The **operator ceiling** (:class:`KnowledgeStageCeiling`) is built
  once from settings at wiring time. A stage the ceiling forbids
  (gate disabled via env, no reranker configured) stays off in EVERY
  profile.
* The **profile** selects within the ceiling. Any clamping is visible
  in :attr:`KnowledgeRunPlan.degraded_stages` — never silent.

There is exactly ONE resolution site (:func:`resolve_run_plan`); no
other code interprets profile names. The module is deliberately free
of settings/provider imports so it can be consumed from the algorithm,
the composition root, and the capabilities manifest without cycles.
