"""W3C trace-context propagation across the run job queue.

The API injects the current trace context into the durable
``request_payload`` under one top-level key; the worker extracts it and
parents its execution span there — ONE trace from HTTP request through
submit to the worker's LLM calls. The queue message itself stays
untouched (``(run_id, tenant_id)``): the context travels in the run row,
so replays and takeovers see it too.

Every function degrades to a no-op without the ``observability`` extra
or without an active span — old rows, disabled tracing, and mixed
worker versions all keep working (a missing field simply starts a fresh
root span on the worker).
