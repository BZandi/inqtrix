"""File spool for spans (``INQTRIX_TRACING=file``).

The Baukasten mode between "nothing" and "live backend": spans are
written as **standard OTLP-JSON** lines into rotating files, so a
deployment records full debug depth WITHOUT running Langfuse — and can
import the files later (each line is one ``ExportTraceServiceRequest``
rendered with the official protobuf JSON mapping, i.e. directly
POST-able to any OTLP/HTTP-JSON endpoint such as Langfuse's
``/api/public/otel/v1/traces``).

Retention here is SIZE-based (the plan's 2-GiB backstop): one file per
writer, rotated at a fixed slice size, oldest files deleted once the
directory exceeds the configured total. Time-based retention is the
backend's job in ``otlp`` mode, not the spool's.

Shared-directory safety: several processes (host-mode API + worker) may
spool into the same directory. Every writer owns files it created in
this incarnation (pid + random token in the name, created O_EXCL) and
never appends to anyone else's. The total cap counts the WHOLE
directory; foreign files are protected only while fresh — once nothing
has written to them for :data:`_FOREIGN_STALE_SECONDS` their writer is
gone or idle and they become reclaimable, so dead processes can never
grow the directory beyond the cap forever.
