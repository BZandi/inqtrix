"""Contracts of the file-asset-record store (M6c).

Mirrors editor_ports: the store owns persistence only; scoping lives in
:class:`~inqtrix.services.asset_records_service.AssetRecordsService` and
the wire shape in the router. Two implementations behind one port:
:class:`~inqtrix.project.asset_records_memory.MemoryAssetStore` (offline/
test) and :class:`~inqtrix.project.asset_records_postgres.PostgresAssetStore`.

Like editor documents, an asset carries a heavy ``extracted_text`` body:
``list_assets_page`` returns metadata only (``extracted_text=""``);
``get_asset`` returns the full record with the text (load-on-open).
