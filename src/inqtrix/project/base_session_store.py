"""Shared session scaffolding for the tenant-scoped project stores.

Every Postgres project-persistence store (chat, editor, and the M6c asset
/ vector-index / account-preferences stores) opens its sessions the same
way: a dedicated NullPool engine, a session factory bound to it, and a
:func:`~inqtrix.storage.db.tenant_session` (restricted role +
transaction-local tenant GUC, the RLS layering). Defined once here
(Designprinzip 4) so the boilerplate cannot drift between stores; the
entity-specific schema, queries, and upserts stay in each subclass.

The session lifecycle is identical regardless of a store's row shape: the
account-preferences store is a single-row, user-keyed table (no keyset
list) yet still subclasses this — the keyset shape only affects its
queries, never how it opens a tenant session.
