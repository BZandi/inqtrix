"""Contracts of the chat-history store (Baukasten port + dataclasses).

The store owns persistence only: scoping decisions (which threads a
caller may see, whether a write needs an edit grant) live in
:class:`~inqtrix.services.chat_history_service.ChatHistoryService`, and
the wire shape lives in the router. Two implementations behind the same
port: :class:`~inqtrix.project.chat_memory.MemoryChatStore` (the tier
without Postgres, also the offline test backend) and
:class:`~inqtrix.project.chat_postgres.PostgresChatStore`. All methods
are async — the platform persistence layer is async end-to-end
(asyncpg), and a uniform async port lets the HTTP routes ``await``
directly.
