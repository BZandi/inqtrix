"""Contracts of the editor-patch store (M7).

One persisted proposal of anchored document edits (from the editor
assistant's suggest/instruct calls or the workspace agent) with its
apply/reject lifecycle. Mirrors :mod:`inqtrix.project.editor_ports`:
the store owns persistence only; the parent-document visibility rule and
the CAS apply live in
:class:`~inqtrix.services.editor_patch_service.EditorPatchService`, the
wire shape in the router. Two implementations behind the same port:
:class:`~inqtrix.project.editor_patch_memory.MemoryEditorPatchStore`
(offline/test tier) and
:class:`~inqtrix.storage.editor_patch_postgres.PostgresEditorPatchStore`.

Retention: a patch is a child of its DOCUMENT (``ON DELETE CASCADE`` in
Postgres; the memory tier mirrors it logically — every access resolves
the document first, so patches of a deleted document become unreachable,
the ``control_memory`` precedent). The optional ``run_id`` back-reference
uses ``ON DELETE SET NULL`` instead: the durable run retention window may
expire the run long before the document dies, and the patch record (the
applied-edit truth) must survive that.
