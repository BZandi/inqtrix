"""Algorithm adapters for the existing web-research graph.

``run_web_graph`` / ``run_web_graph_test`` are the registry-side seam
between the platform layer and the LangGraph engine: non-streaming
chat, native ``/v1/runs``, and ``/v1/test/run`` all execute through
this module. Tests that previously monkeypatched
``inqtrix.server.routes.agent_run`` patch
``inqtrix.research.web_research.run_web_graph`` instead — the adapters
resolve the module global at call time, so late patching keeps
working exactly as before.

SECOND seam (deliberate, until streaming dispatches through the
registry): the streamed chat path binds the graph independently as
``inqtrix.server.streaming.agent_run``. Test fakes for streamed chat
must patch THAT name — patching only this module leaves the streaming
path on the real engine.

Both adapters wrap the SAME graph entry point: the research/direct-LLM
split is carried by ``agent_settings.skip_search`` (resolved by the
application service), and the graph branches internally. The two
algorithm classes exist so the registry, capability manifest, and
result typing can treat the modes as first-class peers — when the
direct-LLM path eventually gets its own slim implementation, only this
module changes.
