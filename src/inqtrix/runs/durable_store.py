"""Shared scaffolding for the durable job stores (runs and reindex).

:class:`~inqtrix.runs.postgres_store.PostgresRunStore` and
:class:`~inqtrix.runs.indexing_postgres.PostgresIndexingJobStore` are
two durable stores over the same shape: a sync public surface (routers
and job handles call from worker threads) over an async asyncpg layer.
The schema-agnostic plumbing is genuinely identical between them, so it
lives here once (Designprinzip 4), the same way
:class:`~inqtrix.runs.stream_queue.StreamJobQueue` and
:class:`~inqtrix.worker.loop.BaseWorkerLoop` share the queue and
worker-loop mechanics:

* the dedicated background event loop + ``_call`` sync->async bridge +
  ``close``/``_session`` (asyncpg pools are event-loop-affine, so each
  store owns ONE loop and funnels every DB op through it);
* the no-queue in-process dispatch loop (``_dispatch_locked`` /
  ``_run_worker``), a template method whose claim, handle, and
  terminal-on-success steps are subclass hooks;
* :class:`PollingJobSubscription`, the DB-polling SSE tail, parameterized
  by the terminal-event set and a thread label.

What stays per-store is everything schema-bearing: the SQL bodies, the
run store's share/audit/owner_user_id/result surface, and the indexing
store's history-cap / active-collection / progress semantics.
