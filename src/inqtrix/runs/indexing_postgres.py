"""Durable knowledge-indexing records and events in Postgres.

Same public surface as the in-memory
:class:`~inqtrix.server.indexing.IndexingJobStore` — the indexing routers
and :class:`~inqtrix.services.indexing_service.IndexingService` cannot
tell the backends apart. The durable twin of
:class:`~inqtrix.runs.postgres_store.PostgresRunStore`, built from the
same parts and sharing its worker stack; the differences are the
indexing domain itself: per-document progress, operation-kind and revision
identity, one active collection-generation publication slot per collection,
a per-collection history cap, and no separate share layer.

Two execution modes (mirroring the run store):

* ``queue is None`` (``INQTRIX_STORAGE_BACKEND=postgres`` alone):
  records and events are durable; execution stays in this process with
  the same daemon-thread dispatch as the in-memory store.
* ``queue`` set (``INQTRIX_QUEUE_BACKEND=valkey``): accepted jobs are
  persisted and dispatched to the indexing stream; ``inqtrix-worker``
  claims and executes them from canonical Postgres source revisions. The job
  row is the source of truth.

The storage layer is async (asyncpg) while this surface is sync (the
router and the job handle call it from worker threads); the store owns
one background event loop and funnels every database operation through
it. Sequence numbers are allocated via
``UPDATE indexing_jobs SET event_seq = event_seq + 1 RETURNING event_seq``
— gap-free across processes, which keeps the SSE stream byte-compatible
with the in-memory store.

The schema-agnostic plumbing — the ``_call``/``close``/``_session``
async-loop bridge, the background-loop construction, the no-queue
in-process dispatch loop, and the DB-polling SSE subscription — lives
once in :class:`~inqtrix.runs.durable_store.DurableJobStoreBase` and
:class:`~inqtrix.runs.durable_store.PollingJobSubscription`, shared with
the run store. Only the schema-bearing bodies stay here: the SQL, the
visibility predicate, and this store's history-cap / active-collection /
progress semantics.

            background loop, so the engine is deliberately NOT shared

        app_role: Restricted database role assumed per transaction
            (``SET LOCAL ROLE``) so forced RLS applies.
        queue: Indexing dispatch queue; ``None`` keeps execution in this
            process (durable records, unchanged threading).
        max_concurrent: In-process execution slots (no-queue mode) and
            part of the queue-saturation formula.
        max_queue_size: Waiting-job bound; exceeding it with all slots
            busy rejects submissions (HTTP 429 upstream).
        completed_ttl_seconds: Retention for terminal jobs; lazy cleanup
            deletes older rows (events cascade).
        history_limit: Maximum terminal jobs retained per collection
            (the inline "last N" history); older terminal rows for a
            collection are deleted beyond this count.
        worker_id: Identity stamped into ``claimed_by`` for jobs this

        recover_orphans: Whether this instance may blanket-fail
            queued/running/cancelling rows left by a previous process.
            Durable paused rows are never restart orphans. ``None``
            infers from ``queue`` (no-queue single API process sweeps,

            explicit ``False`` — its ``queue=None`` is claim-mode
            wiring, stream reclaim owns crash recovery there.

    Tenancy: job rows live in the single deployment tenant (``default``)
    at the RLS layer — per-user visibility is the

    the run store and the in-memory indexing store.
