"""Durable run store: records, events, and results in Postgres.

Same public surface as the in-memory
:class:`~inqtrix.server.runs.RunStore` — the runs router and
:class:`~inqtrix.services.run_service.RunService` cannot tell the
backends apart. Two execution modes:

* ``queue`` and ``dispatch_queue`` are both ``None``
  (``INQTRIX_STORAGE_BACKEND=postgres`` alone):
  records, events, and results are durable; execution stays in this
  process with the same thread-dispatch semantics as the memory store.
* an external dispatch queue set (``INQTRIX_QUEUE_BACKEND=valkey``): accepted runs are
  persisted and dispatched to the job stream; ``inqtrix-worker``
  processes claim and execute them. The run row is the source of
  truth — a lost stream message is recoverable from Postgres, and the
  guarded status transitions make at-least-once delivery idempotent.

The storage layer is async (asyncpg) while this surface is sync (the
routers and the run-handle call it from worker threads); the store
therefore owns one background event loop and funnels every database
operation through it. Sequence numbers are allocated via
``UPDATE runs SET event_seq = event_seq + 1 RETURNING event_seq`` —
serialized on the row lock, gap-free across processes, which is what
keeps the SSE stream byte-compatible with the in-memory store.

    Args:
        engine: Async engine OWNED by this store. asyncpg pools are
            event-loop-affine: every connection must live on the
            store's background loop, so the engine is deliberately NOT
            shared with the identity/file backends (which run on the
            HTTP server's loop) — sharing one pool across loops
            corrupts connections.
        app_role: Restricted database role assumed per transaction
            (``SET LOCAL ROLE``) so forced RLS applies.
        queue: Job queue for worker dispatch; ``None`` keeps execution
            ownership in this process. The claim-mode worker deliberately
            leaves this ``None`` because it claims through
            :class:`WorkerLoop`.
        dispatch_queue: Optional external queue used only for submissions,
            resumes, and child-triggered parent wakes. Defaults to *queue*;
            the claim-mode worker passes Valkey here while keeping *queue*
            ``None`` so ownership/fencing semantics do not change.
        max_concurrent: In-process execution slots (no-queue mode) and
            part of the queue-saturation formula.
        max_queue_size: Waiting-run bound; exceeding it with all slots
            busy rejects submissions (HTTP 429 upstream).
        completed_ttl_seconds: Retention for terminal runs; lazy
            cleanup deletes older rows (events cascade).
        worker_id: Identity stamped into ``claimed_by`` for runs this
            process executes or fences.
        audit: Optional audit sink; visibility denials are persisted
            here in addition to the operator log line (closing the
            gap the in-memory store deliberately deferred to G6).
        recover_orphans: Whether this instance may blanket-fail
            queued/running rows left by a previous process. ``None``
            infers from ``queue`` (no-queue single API process sweeps,
            queue mode never); the queue-backed WORKER passes an
            explicit ``False`` because its ``queue=None`` is claim-mode
            wiring and stream reclaim owns crash recovery there.

    Tenancy: run rows live in the single deployment tenant
    (``default``) at the RLS layer — exactly like the in-memory store,
    per-user visibility is the ``(created_by_user_id, created_by_tenant_id)``
    predicate, never the row tenant. True multi-tenant run storage
    arrives with the OIDC rollout and gets its own decision.

        Runs inside the child's terminal transaction (or the park-time
        self-heal): the sibling probe and the parent CAS commit together
        with the child's transition. The CAS keys on
        ``waiting_for_children`` alone (resume is attempt-agnostic,
        exactly like ``_resume_db``); a parent still RUNNING — the child
        finished before the parent finished parking — makes this a no-op,
        closed by the park-time self-heal in ``_mark_waiting_db``.

        The caller already holds the canonical root-to-child lineage; this
        method re-locks the parent row (``FOR NO KEY UPDATE``) reentrantly.
        This is load-bearing under multi-worker queue mode: two of the
        parent's children terminating in CONCURRENT transactions on
        DIFFERENT workers run under READ COMMITTED, where each cannot see
        the other's uncommitted terminal write. Without the lock, both
        sibling probes would count the other child as still outstanding
        (=1) and BOTH decline to wake — a lost wake-up that strands the
        parent until the waiting TTL. The row lock serialises the two
        wake deciders on the parent: the later one blocks until the
        earlier commits, then re-reads the true committed count (0) and
        wakes. NO KEY UPDATE suffices — no PK/FK column is touched — and
        is lighter than FOR UPDATE. Child terminalization, parking, child
        admission, and cancellation all acquire lineage in the same
        root-to-leaf order; this parent lock is therefore never a child-to-
        parent inversion.

        Returns:
            The parent id when the flip landed (caller hands it to the
            post-commit dispatch), ``None`` otherwise.

        selects every queued/running row — in-process closures did not
        survive the restart) and the pre-filtered id lists of the
        lost-execution fence and the stuck-row failsafe. The status CAS
        is the true guard: a candidate that finished or got claimed in
        the meantime is skipped silently.

        The blanket restart selection assumes a SINGLE API process in
        no-queue durable mode (the documented deployment shape): a
        second process sharing the database would have its in-flight
        runs swept here. Multi replica deployments use the queue
