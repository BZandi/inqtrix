"""HTTP gate that keeps business routes behind the database contract.

The gate is pure ASGI because it only reads the request path and application
state. A ``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` task hop cancels downstream streaming work
when a browser closes an SSE response; that cancellation can also interrupt
async database-driver termination and return a dead connection to the pool.
