"""Named thread lanes for the blocking work the HTTP server offloads.

Three kinds of blocking work share the API process, and they behave nothing
alike. An AI call occupies its thread for the whole request — minutes, for a
research answer. A stream reader blocks on a queue, wakes, and re-arms for as
long as a viewer watches. Everything else is a short read that wants its thread
back immediately.

Left in one pool they starve each other: enough concurrent AI calls and no
thread remains for a stream reader to deliver an event or for a metrics scrape
to answer, even though the event loop is idle the whole time. Worse, the pool
that would absorb them is sized ``min(32, os.cpu_count() + 4)`` — a number
derived from the machine's cores, which in a container is not the CPU budget
the process actually has.

So the two long-lived kinds get their own named lane, which leaves the default
pool to the short reads — with one exception worth knowing: the per-user
invalidation stream still parks a default-pool thread per connected client when
the in-memory user-event store is in use (the Postgres store waits on the event
loop instead and costs nothing here).

``ai``
    Slots for concurrent AI calls. Admission bounds how many may START
    (``MAX_CONCURRENT``), but not how many are still RUNNING: a client that
    navigates away closes the streaming generator, which releases its
    admission slot while the thread it started keeps working until the
    algorithm reaches its next cancellation checkpoint. Sizing the lane to
    the admission ceiling exactly would let those orphans crowd out requests
    that admission has just accepted, so the lane carries a full extra
    generation of headroom.

``streams``
    One slot per open event stream while it waits for its next event. Sized
    separately because the number of viewers is not bounded by the number of
    runs — several people may watch the same run, and indexing streams are
    counted here too.

A blocked thread is cheap: parked on a lock it holds a few kilobytes and does
not take the interpreter lock. Sizing a lane generously costs far less than
letting one class of work displace another.
