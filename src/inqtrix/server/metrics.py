"""Optional Prometheus ``/metrics`` endpoint (scaling measure 2.5).

Off by default (``INQTRIX_METRICS_ENABLED``). Only ``prometheus-client``
is required — it ships in the optional ``metrics`` extra; when the flag
is on but the extra is not installed, this module logs a loud WARNING
and leaves ``/metrics`` unmounted rather than crashing startup (a
missing OPTIONAL dependency is an operator misconfiguration to surface,
not a fatal one — the visibility lives in the log).

The HTTP request histograms come from a small in-tree ASGI middleware
rather than ``prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator`` on purpose: that
package pins ``starlette<1.0`` and would force a project-wide starlette
downgrade for an optional feature. Labelling by the matched route
TEMPLATE (``scope["route"].path`` = ``/v1/runs/{run_id}``) keeps the
cardinality bounded without it.

Metric surface (NO run-id, subject, or session labels ever):

* ``inqtrix_run_queue_depth`` / ``inqtrix_run_active`` /
  ``inqtrix_run_capacity`` — gauges read at scrape time from the run
  store's read-only :class:`~inqtrix.runs.ports.RunStoreMetrics`
  snapshot (capacity only for the in-process memory backend).
* ``inqtrix_run_admission_rejected_total{reason}`` — a counter bumped
  at the run/quota admission-rejection sites via
  :func:`record_admission_rejected`.
* ``inqtrix_http_requests_total{method,handler,status}`` and
  ``inqtrix_http_request_duration_seconds{method,handler}`` — per-route
  request count and latency, keyed on the route template.

Each ``create_app`` gets its OWN ``CollectorRegistry``, so repeated app
construction in tests never trips prometheus' duplicate-timeseries guard.
