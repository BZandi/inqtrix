"""Shared parsing, rendering and budgeting for editor reference documents.

Both editor prompt builders -- the document-level instruction
(:mod:`inqtrix.server.editor_instructions`) and the paragraph rewrite
(:mod:`inqtrix.server.editor_suggestions`) -- accept the same additive
``attachments`` request field: user-supplied source documents (files, file
groups, prior reports) that the model may cite from but must never treat as an
instruction. This module is the single place that validates that field, renders
it into a delimiter-wrapped block whose ``[N]`` headers line up with the ``[N]``
references the frontend writes into the instruction text, and clamps the joined
content to the model context budget. Defining it once keeps the two builders in
sync (Designprinzip 4: no redundancy).

The block is framed in English to match the editor system rules, which are
English for instruction-following reliability. The delimiter style mirrors the
frontend chat path (``features/files/referenceBlocks.ts``); see conventions.md.
