"""Per-surface router factories for the Inqtrix HTTP server.

Each module exposes ``build_router(container) -> APIRouter`` and stays
thin: parse the request, delegate to a service, serialize the result.
The shared :class:`~inqtrix.server.container.AppContainer` carries the
collaborators; FastAPI's ``Depends`` is used only for the principal
dependency so every gated endpoint resolves a
:class:`~inqtrix.auth.principal.Principal` uniformly.
