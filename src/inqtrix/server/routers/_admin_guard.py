"""Shared instance-admin request guard (single authorization axis).

The instance-admin check — cookie session -> users-mirror ->
``instance_role == "admin"`` — is the platform-administration axis. It
gates user management (:mod:`inqtrix.server.routers.admin`), quota
administration (:mod:`inqtrix.server.routers.quota`), and admin workspace
management. Defining it once here keeps every administrative surface
byte-identical: SESSION-ONLY (a personal access token can never administer,
so a leaked token cannot promote itself), a disabled admin loses the
surface even within the brief session-purge race window, and denial hides
behind a 404 (the permission layer's not-403 convention).

It is deliberately distinct from :class:`inqtrix.auth.permissions.WorkspaceRole`:
workspace ownership is the *collaboration* axis (sharing, invitations within
one workspace) and never confers tenant-wide administrative power.
