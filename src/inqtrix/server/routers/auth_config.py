"""Public auth-config discovery: ``GET /api/auth/config``.

Unauthenticated and ALWAYS mounted (like ``/health``) so the SPA can pick
the correct login surface — an SSO button vs an email/password form vs an
API-key field — and learn the session contract BEFORE authenticating. The
BFF auth router (``/api/auth/login``, ``/callback`` ...) is mounted only in
the cookie-session modes, so this discovery route lives in its own
always-on router rather than there.

Distinct from ``/api/auth/session`` (post-login identity) and from the
IdP's own ``/.well-known/openid-configuration`` (machine discovery at the
issuer): this is the app-level, pre-login login-UI hint. Every field is
derived from an existing seam, so there is no new source of truth.
