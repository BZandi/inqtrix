"""OpenAI-compatible ``/v1/chat/completions`` endpoint.

Streamed and non-streamed responses both dispatch the resolved mode through
the :class:`~inqtrix.core.algorithms.AlgorithmRegistry`: streaming via
:func:`guarded_stream` (which drives ``algorithm.run`` with a per-request
:class:`~inqtrix.core.context.RunContext`), the non-streaming path via the
:class:`~inqtrix.services.chat_service.ChatService`. Both share the single
graph seam ``inqtrix.research.web_research.run_web_graph``.

        than the caller picked would change the answer's meaning without

        every other mode either ignores the filter or (workspace agent)
