"""User search for the share typeahead — mounted only in oidc mode.

Privacy posture: any AUTHENTICATED tenant user can find any other by
prefix — acceptable for a closed deployment whose signup is gated by
invitations; enumeration without a query is impossible (minimum two
characters, capped results), disabled users never appear, and the
payload carries only the canonical user id, display name, and email.

When ``settings.sharing.restrict_to_workspace_members`` is on, the results
are additionally narrowed to the caller's workspace co-members — the
typeahead half of the workspace-scoped sharing policy (the grant path
enforces the same boundary). Default off keeps the search tenant-wide.
