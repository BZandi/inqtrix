    ``None`` is an anonymous/static principal and may see only ownerless rows.
    A scoped principal sees runs owned by its canonical UUID in the same
    tenant. Ownerless records stay invisible to scoped principals rather than
    leaking across users. Shared access is resolved by the authorization
    layer, not by broadening this owner predicate.
