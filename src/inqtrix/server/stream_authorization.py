"""Generation-gated per-frame authorization for long-lived SSE streams.

One shared gate for the run and indexing event streams (previously two
hand-copied ``_authorized_frame`` closures that had already drifted).
Per frame the gate reads the user's commit-ordered authorization
generation — one indexed SELECT inside one short tenant transaction
(checkout, role/tenant setup, SELECT, commit) — and re-runs the FULL
authoritative chain (credential resolver, user context, resource
visibility: three such transactions plus a run-store read) only when the
generation moved or a bounded time ceiling elapsed. The generation
is a HINT, never a decision: over-invalidation merely re-runs the chain.

The time ceiling is part of the security contract, not a fallback:
session EXPIRY writes no mutation and therefore bumps nothing, so the
ceiling is the guaranteed upper bound for it (and for any future
under-invalidation). Principals without a generation (api-key mode,
memory identity backend) run the full chain on every frame — exactly the
pre-gate behavior, never a silently weaker check.

A mutation may still commit between the generation read and the frame's
``yield``; that one-frame window existed with the per-frame full chain
too and is unchanged.
