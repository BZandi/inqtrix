) -> None:
    """Background task: signal *cancel_event* on the next ``http.disconnect``.

    Why this is a dedicated task rather than a poll inside the streaming
    loop: ``Request.is_disconnected()`` is a non-blocking probe that uses
    an ``anyio.CancelScope().cancel()`` trick to read the ASGI receive
    channel without blocking. uvicorn does not deliver ``http.disconnect``
    via that path during an active streaming response (its ASGI receive
    side stays idle while we only write SSE chunks), so the probe never
    flips. A blocking ``await request.receive()`` in a parallel task is
    the only reliable way to surface the disconnect. Polling alone can
    miss it and allow a long-running request to complete after the client
    has already aborted.

    The mechanism is transport-generic: after a JSON route has consumed
    its request body, the next ``receive()`` parks the same way until
    connection loss, so non-streaming handlers use this watcher too.

    Args:
        request: The Starlette/FastAPI request whose receive channel we
            listen on. Must be the live request object the route handler
            saw — passing a stale or replayed request silently no-ops.
        cancel_event: Threading event the LangGraph node-boundary probe
            (``inqtrix.state.check_cancel_event``) consults. We set it
            on the first ``http.disconnect`` message; subsequent messages
            are ignored. Setting is thread-safe (used by both the asyncio
            loop here and the agent ThreadPoolExecutor that reads it).

    Notes:
        * The task exits as soon as the disconnect is observed. The
          caller — normally :func:`disconnect_watch`, or the streaming
          generator's own shutdown — is responsible for cancelling this
          task on normal completion (``task.cancel()`` + ``await task``
          with ``CancelledError`` swallowed) so it does not leak.
        * Any exception inside ``request.receive()`` (e.g. underlying
          transport torn down by uvicorn) also signals the cancel — we
          treat unexpected receive errors as "client gone" rather than
          continuing without the disconnect signal.

    non-streamed chat path and native ``/v1/runs`` — there is no longer a
    separate graph binding for streaming. Graph-backed modes (research,
    direct_llm) stream their coarse progress through the ``progress_queue`` as
    before, byte-identically; event-only modes (knowledge) carry no
    ``event_sink`` here and stream the answer without granular progress lines
    (the rich progress surface for those is native ``/v1/runs`` SSE).

    When ``request`` is supplied (server route path), a background
    :func:`watch_disconnect` task is spawned. It blocks on
    ``await request.receive()`` and sets ``cancel_event`` as soon as
    uvicorn delivers ``http.disconnect`` — the only ASGI signal that
    actually fires when an SSE client closes the socket mid-stream.
    The streaming loop only checks ``cancel_event`` (no own polling)
    and exits the generator when set.

    ``cancel_event`` defaults to a fresh :class:`threading.Event` when
    not supplied so library tests can still inspect the sequence
    without wiring a Request object. Backwards compatibility: tests
    that supply a Request mock with ``is_disconnected()`` continue to
    pass because the watcher only depends on ``await request.receive()``
