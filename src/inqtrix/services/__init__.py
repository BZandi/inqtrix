"""Application services between the HTTP routers and the algorithms.

Routers stay thin (parse, delegate, serialize); services own the
orchestration that used to live inside the monolithic route factory:
stack resolution, per-request override/mode resolution, payload caps,
run submission, and chat-completion execution. Every service receives
its collaborators via the constructor (Designprinzip 6) and is built
once in :func:`inqtrix.server.container.build_container`.
