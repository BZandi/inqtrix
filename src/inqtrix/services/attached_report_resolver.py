"""Resolution of attached research reports against the caller's own runs.

A client sends run ids and nothing else. Existence, completion and the
report's name are read server-side under the CALLER's visibility, exactly
as the prompt-library rules are resolved: an id the caller cannot see
must fail loudly, because starting a run whose attachments silently
vanished is the failure this whole channel exists to prevent.

Only the NAME travels into the prompt. The body stays where it is and is
fetched later by ``read_research_report`` — a real report has a median of
~54k characters, and its sources only become citable by going through the
evidence ledger, which an inlined text could never do.
