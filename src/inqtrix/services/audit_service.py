"""Enriched audit writing for the event catalog (OCSF-oriented).

ONE place builds the full audit envelope so every writer stays a
one-liner and the columns fill consistently:

* ``correlation`` — request_id/run_id from the ambient log context plus
  the active trace id, the drill-down join keys into JSON logs and
  Langfuse.
* ``origin`` — ip/user_agent/auth_method from
  :mod:`inqtrix.auth.request_origin` (empty for worker-side events —
  absence is meaningful).
* ``actor_pseudonym`` — the stable ``usr_<hex16>`` computed at write
  time, so the admin panel lists exactly the identifier logs and traces
  carry.

Two failure disciplines, chosen PER CALL SITE:

* Security-relevant admin actions keep the established FAIL-LOUD path
  (call ``sink.record`` directly and let a failing sink fail the
  request — e.g. pseudonym resolution, trace export).
* Lifecycle telemetry (service starts, uploads, deletions) uses
  :meth:`AuditService.record` — FAIL-SAFE but never fail-SILENT: an
  audit outage must not take down runs, and every swallowed failure is
  a WARNING (see feedback rule "keine stillen Fallbacks").
