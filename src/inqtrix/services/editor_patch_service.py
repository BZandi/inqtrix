"""Editor-patch lifecycle service (M7).

Orchestrates the patch store pair behind
:class:`~inqtrix.project.editor_patch_ports.EditorPatchStore` together
with the :class:`~inqtrix.services.editor_persistence_service.EditorPersistenceService`:
propose snapshots the document revision, apply is a CAS against the
document's CURRENT revision plus the deterministic server-side edit
application (:func:`apply_edits`), reject records the decision.

Access: EVERY method resolves the parent DOCUMENT through the editor
persistence service with the caller's ``visible_to`` context first — an
unknown or foreign document answers with the same indistinct not-found
the document routes use (denial == absence). Patch-scoped methods convert
that into :class:`PatchNotFound` so a foreign caller cannot learn that a
patch exists at all.

    Mirrors the anchor semantics of
    :mod:`inqtrix.server.editor_instructions` and the frontend's
    anchoring intent — and NEVER guesses:

    * ``find`` must occur verbatim in the current document. When it
      occurs multiple times, ``quote_before``/``quote_after`` pick the
      occurrence whose surrounding text contains them nearest; a still
      ambiguous (tied) or unresolvable anchor SKIPS the edit (non-fatal,
      excluded from the applied ids).
    * ``replace`` substitutes ``text`` for ``find`` (empty ``text`` is a
      deletion); ``before``/``after`` insert ``text`` with a blank-line
      separation adjacent to the anchor; ``append`` (empty ``find``)
      appends ``text`` after a blank line at the document end.
    * Edits apply SEQUENTIALLY against the evolving document — later
      anchors resolve against the already-updated text.

    Args:
        content: The current document markdown.
        edits: Edit objects in the persisted shape (each carrying its
            propose-assigned ``id``); read-only here — the dicts are

            skipped, never fatal.
