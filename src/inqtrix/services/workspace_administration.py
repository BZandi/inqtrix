"""Shared workspace-name validation and admin creation command.

Three routes take a workspace name — self-serve creation
(``POST /v1/workspaces``), admin creation (``POST /v1/admin/workspaces``)
and admin rename (``PATCH /v1/admin/workspaces/{id}``). All of them must
apply the same validation, and both creation surfaces must behave
identically, so the validate/create body lives here exactly once; the
repositories write audit and invalidation effects inside the same mutation
boundary.
