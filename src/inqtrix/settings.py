"""Pydantic Settings stack for type-safe environment-variable configuration.

This module bridges the user-facing ``.env`` / process-env surface to typed
Python objects consumed by :class:`~inqtrix.agent.ResearchAgent` and the HTTP
server. Three concerns are split into dedicated classes (``ModelSettings``,
``AgentSettings``, ``ServerSettings``) and re-aggregated by :class:`Settings`
so providers, agents, and routes can subscribe only to the slice they need.

Precedence (highest wins):

1. Programmatic ``AgentConfig`` overrides (in library mode)
2. Real process environment variables
3. ``.env`` file in the current working directory
4. Built-in defaults defined here
