"""Async engine construction and the tenant-scoped transaction helper.

The tenant helper is the single sanctioned way to touch tenant tables:
every call opens ONE transaction, switches to the restricted
application role, and sets the transaction-local ``inqtrix.tenant_id``
GUC the row-level-security policies read. Both steps are
deliberately transaction-scoped:

* ``SET LOCAL ROLE`` reverts at COMMIT/ROLLBACK, so pooled
  connections never leak the restricted role into unrelated work
  (e.g. migrations sharing a pool in tests).
* ``set_config(..., is_local => true)`` reverts the tenant id the
  same way — the only safe form under connection pooling, where a
  session-scoped value would leak the previous tenant to the next
  request (PgBouncer transaction mode skips reset queries entirely).

The policies fail closed on top of this: the
``inqtrix_current_tenant_id()`` helper raises when the GUC is unset
*or* empty (after a transaction-local value reverts, the parameter
survives as an empty string for the connection lifetime — the
documented ``current_setting`` gotcha), so a forgotten
``tenant_session`` produces a loud error, never another tenant's rows.

Request cancellation cannot be allowed to interrupt transaction
finalization. ``tenant_session`` shields rollback/commit and session close
from both AnyIO level cancellation and direct asyncio task cancellation, so
an abandoned HTTP response cannot strand a checked-out pool connection.

Transaction-pooler contract (PgBouncer ``pool_mode=transaction``): this
module is deliberately pooler-safe — no session-scoped SET, no
LISTEN/NOTIFY, no session advisory locks — and MUST stay that way; a
future session-scoped feature would silently break behind a pooler.
Two operational requirements remain on the DEPLOYMENT side: (1) asyncpg
prepared statements need either ``?prepared_statement_cache_size=0`` in
the URL or PgBouncer >= 1.21 with ``max_prepared_statements`` tracking
(the bundled compose/helm pgbouncer sets both); (2) Alembic migrations
(``inqtrix-migrate``) connect DIRECTLY to Postgres, never through the
pooler — DDL and long transactions do not multiplex.

    asyncpg connections are event-loop-affine. A pooled engine therefore
    belongs to exactly ONE loop: either a persistent one (the HTTP loop, a
    job store's dedicated loop) or none at all. Reached from a second loop
    — the classic case being a sync run thread driving it through
    ``run_coro_sync``/``asyncio.run``, one fresh loop per call — the pool
    hands back a connection bound to a foreign or already-dead loop and
    ``pool_pre_ping`` fails with "Future attached to a different loop". The
    same reuse also corrupts asyncpg's protocol state and poisons the pool
    for every later borrower, including the request path.

    :mod:`inqtrix.sync_bridge`, :func:`build_engine` and
    ``build_run_thread_persistence`` all state the resulting invariant —
    anything reachable from a per-call loop MUST sit on a NullPool engine —

    ``sync_bridge`` (the agents use bare ``asyncio.run``), so no wrapper

    every tenant-scoped read and write passes through.

    Warns rather than raises: the asyncpg failure follows within the same
    call anyway, so raising would only replace one error with another. The
