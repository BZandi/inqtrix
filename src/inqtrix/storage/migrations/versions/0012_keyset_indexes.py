"""Keyset-pagination indexes: append the id tiebreaker to the list sorts.

Revision ID: 0012_keyset_indexes
Revises: 0011_indexing_jobs

M5 introduces keyset/cursor pagination on the list endpoints. A keyset
cursor over ``created_at`` alone is unsafe here: ``created_at`` is a float
unix epoch (``time.time()``) on these tables, and bulk inserts / seeds
routinely share a timestamp — so a ``(created_at)`` boundary can skip or
repeat rows at a page edge. The cursor is therefore the tuple
``(created_at, <pk>)``, and the supporting index must carry the pk as the
tiebreaker after ``created_at``.

Replaces the two-column ``(scope, created_at)`` indexes with three-column
``(scope, created_at, pk)`` ones for the two lists that gain pagination in
M5 (runs, knowledge_documents). The new composite is a strict superset of
the old prefix, so nothing that used the old index regresses. Idempotent
in both directions so a fresh database (which built the new index from the
updated ORM via the earlier ``create_all`` migrations) and an already
migrated one converge.

Other list endpoints (collections, prompt-templates, indexing-jobs,
shares) are deliberately NOT paginated in M5 — their lists stay small or
bounded, or their visibility is a service-layer filter that a DB ``LIMIT``
would under-fill — so their indexes are left unchanged.
