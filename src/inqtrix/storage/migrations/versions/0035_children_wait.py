"""Widen ck_runs_status for the waiting_for_children park (A1).

Revision ID: 0035_children_wait
Revises: 0034_agent_memory_feedback

An agent parent no longer block-polls its child research runs out of
the shared execution pool: it parks slot-free in the NEW
``waiting_for_children`` status and the store re-queues it when the
last child terminates. The ``ck_runs_status`` CHECK is rebuilt from the
status vocabulary deployed with this revision. The literal keeps later
application-enum changes from rewriting migration history. No columns change
-- the park reuses ``waiting_since`` and the 0029 waiting machinery.
