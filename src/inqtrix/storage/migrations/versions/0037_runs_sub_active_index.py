"""Index created_by_sub over active runs for the per-user in-flight cap.

Revision ID: 0037_runs_sub_active_index
Revises: 0036_agent_memory_rls_guc
Create Date: 2026-07-04

The optional per-user in-flight run cap COUNTs
``created_by_sub = ? AND kind != 'agent' AND status IN ('queued','running')``
inside every ``POST /v1/runs`` transaction. No ``runs`` index led with
``created_by_sub``; the tenant-leading indexes do not narrow by subject on a
single-tenant deployment, so the COUNT degraded to a status scan over every
active run fleet-wide per submit. A partial index on
``(created_by_sub, status)`` restricted to the two active statuses turns it
into a user-scoped index lookup (the ``kind != 'agent'`` residual is cheap on
that small set). Matches the ORM ``ix_runs_sub_active`` so fresh installs and
already-migrated databases converge; idempotent both directions.
