"""Enforce agent-session concurrency and memo-only singleton artifacts.

Revision ID: 0042_agent_session_integrity
Revises: 0041_skill_templates
Create Date: 2026-07-10

Only a root ``kind='agent'`` run occupies the session execution lease.
Queued, running, and every parked waiting status retain it; terminal rows and
agent children do not.  The partial unique index is the cross-process race
backstop for concurrent API submissions.

The previous artifact index made every session artifact kind a singleton,
which contradicted the multi-deliverable contract already implemented by the
control stores.  Memo remains the sole session singleton; deliverables are
addressed by ``artifact_id`` and revision CAS.
