"""Add imported-run identity and explicit execution authority.

Revision ID: 0046_execution_authority
Revises: 0045_canonical_user_ids
Create Date: 2026-07-14

Imported reports no longer reuse a client-controlled id as the public run id.
``source_run_id`` is an owner-scoped idempotency key while ``run_id`` remains
server-generated and never reusable. The execution columns establish the
schema contract for the separate effective-actor/safepoint phase.

Reindex cancellation becomes an explicit active state. Consequently the
one-active-job index continues to reserve a collection while cancellation is
pending instead of briefly reopening it to mutations or another reindex.
