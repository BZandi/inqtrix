"""SQLAlchemy Core definitions of the vector-index-record schema (M6c).

The vector-index layer of the project-persistence tier: the local file
library's RAG indexes (the file<->collection mapping the user builds for
retrieval), scoped per ``(tenant_id, created_by_user_id, workspace_id)`` like
the chat/editor/asset entities. The vectors themselves live in Qdrant and
the canonical chunk text in ``knowledge_*`` (M2); ``server_collection_id``
references that backend collection. What persists HERE is the client's
index record: its identity, embedding model/dims, lifecycle status, the
n:m membership of files, and the capped run history shown inline.

One record with two owned child collections, both travelling WITH the
record (the serialized ``VectorIndexRecord`` carries them) and therefore
replaced wholesale on each upsert — no per-child endpoint, unlike editor
comments:

* ``vector_index_members``  — the documents referenced by the index
  (composite PK ``(index_id, file_id)``; ``state`` is the only persisted
  lifecycle datum — chunk/vector counts are derived, never stored).
* ``vector_index_history``  — past reindex runs, newest first, capped at
  the frontend's ``VECTOR_INDEX_HISTORY_LIMIT``. History entries have no
  client identity, so their order IS their key: composite PK
  ``(index_id, seq)`` with ``seq`` the 0-based newest-first position.

Type decisions match the chat/editor/asset ORMs: the opaque client-supplied
id (e.g. ``vector-index-...``) as the record PK, unix-seconds ``Float`` timestamps,
per-table ``tenant_id`` for the RLS layering, keyset index with the id
tiebreaker. CHECK constraints pin the status / member state / run result
to the frontend unions (``VectorIndexStatus`` / ``VectorIndexMemberState``
/ ``VectorIndexRunResult``) so an out-of-domain write fails loudly.
