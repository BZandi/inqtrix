    Prices change; the ledger stores tokens, never money. The price source
    follows the operation, because the catalogues are genuinely different
    shapes rather than one shape with gaps:

    - ``chat`` / ``text_completion`` price input and output separately from
      the model cards.
    - ``embeddings`` price input only — an embedding call has no output
      tokens, which is why the embedding card carries a single price.
    - ``web_search`` is billed per call under an operator-named agent
      identifier, not per token, so no token price can be honest here.

    ``None`` means *not priceable*, never *free*. A self-hosted embedding
    model with no list price returns ``None`` for exactly that reason; so
    does an uncatalogued model and an unknown operation. Substituting a
    default price would hide the gap (Designprinzip 1).
