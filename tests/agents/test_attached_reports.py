"""Research reports as agent input (P14).

The operator's use case: take two finished research reports, apply a
prompt-library rule, and write a Sprechzettel — then fact-check one
paragraph and ADD the new source to the document's source list.

The interesting properties are not "a field arrives" but: the attachment
is the consent, a report's own sources become citable in the new run, and
nothing is ever dropped in silence.
