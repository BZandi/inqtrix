"""The knowledge gate names the collections it may reach (P10-K1).

A knowledge approval used to ask about "the project's internal
collections" without naming a single one — while the run's boundary was
already pinned at submission and enforced server-side. Deciding blind is
the defect; these tests pin that the card carries the names, that a
non-knowledge gate stays untouched, and that an unreadable catalog omits
the line instead of inventing one (No Silent Fallbacks).
