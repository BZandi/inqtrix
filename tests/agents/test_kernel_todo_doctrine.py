"""What the kernel is told about keeping its task list current.

The list only changes when the model calls ``write_todos``. A delegation
is ONE tool call that can hold the run for many minutes, so a list
written before it keeps naming a finished step as the current one: in the
run that motivated this rule, "structuring the assignment" stood as
in-progress for fifty minutes while a whole mission ran beneath it.
