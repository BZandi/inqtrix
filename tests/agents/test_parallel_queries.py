"""A task's sub-queries run concurrently and fold in QUERY order.

The queries of one retrieval task used to run in a plain `for` loop.
Measured on a real run, one task spent 9:16 on four queries that never
overlapped, while its four sibling tasks had finished in under 2:30 —
the whole execution phase waited on it.

They are independent by construction: each builds its prompt from
``(task, query)`` alone and reads nothing a sibling produced. Task
DEPENDENCIES live on ``depends_on`` and stay sequenced by the wave
scheduler; nothing here touches that.

What must NOT change is the observable order: the answer text, which
duplicate reference wins, and which failure code carries.
