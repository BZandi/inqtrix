"""Centralised cassette sanitization for VCR-recorded provider tests.

This module is the single source of truth for stripping secrets from
recorded HTTP interactions before they are committed to the repository.
It is consumed by :mod:`tests.replay.conftest` (as ``before_record_request``
and ``before_record_response`` hooks) and by
:mod:`tests.replay.test_sanitization` (as the protective unit-test gate
that scans every committed cassette for left-over credential material).

Lives in ``tests/fixtures/`` rather than ``src/inqtrix/`` because
sanitisation is a test-only concern: production providers receive their
secrets via constructor args and never write them anywhere persistent
(Constructor-First principle, see the project rules). Library code MUST
NOT import from this module.

Conventions:

* Header names are matched **case-insensitive** and replaced with the
  literal placeholder ``"REDACTED"``. Removing the header outright would
  change the request fingerprint and break VCR's matchers; replacing
  the value preserves the structure while neutralising the secret.
* Bearer tokens in any header value (``"Bearer eyJ..."``,
  ``"Bearer sk-..."``) are scrubbed regardless of the header name —
  belt-and-suspenders defence against custom auth headers.
* JSON request bodies are scrubbed key-wise: any field whose name
  matches one of :data:`SECRET_BODY_KEYS` (case-insensitive) gets its
  value replaced. Unknown body shapes (non-JSON, malformed JSON,
  binary) are left untouched — VCR will still see them, but the
  protective scan downstream will still flag obvious patterns.
* Query parameters carrying secrets (``?api_key=...``,
  ``?subscription_key=...``) are scrubbed in :func:`before_record_request`
  by URL-rewriting.
* Response bodies are not scrubbed by default — well-behaved backends
  do not echo secrets back. The protective scan still inspects them as
  a safety net.
