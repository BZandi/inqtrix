"""Provider stand-in that reproduces real call timing without provider cost.

Load measurement needs many concurrent runs. Driving them against real
providers is expensive and rate-limited, and provider latency variance would
dominate the numbers being measured. This server answers the LLM, web-search,
and embedding calls instead, so a load run exercises the application's own
threads, connections, and CPU while provider behaviour stays a controlled
input.

Fidelity rests on two artifacts produced by ``calibrate.py`` from real run
traces:

* a timing profile — per-operation p50/p95/max, sampled per request from a
  lognormal fitted to p50/p95 and clamped at the observed maximum, so the
  spread of real provider latency survives;
* a response corpus — the captured answers themselves, replayed verbatim so
  every response keeps the exact wire format and size the pipeline parses.

Search results are the one synthesised payload: search spans carry no captured
result set. Extracted claims reference results by position rather than by URL,
so synthesised results still resolve.

An incoming request is mapped back to its operation by the opening of its
system instruction, which is unique per pipeline step. Matching is
longest-common-prefix rather than exact because some instructions embed the
current date. A request that matches nothing is answered from a neutral
default AND reported — a silent fallback would quietly turn a measured run
into a meaningless one.

Configuration (all optional):

``INQTRIX_MOCK_PORT``            listen port (default 9300)
``INQTRIX_MOCK_PROFILE``         timing profile path
``INQTRIX_MOCK_CORPUS``          response corpus directory
``INQTRIX_MOCK_EMBEDDING_DIM``   embedding width (default 3072)
``INQTRIX_MOCK_SEARCH_RESULTS``  synthesised results per search (default 8)
``INQTRIX_MOCK_SEED``            base seed for reproducible sampling
``INQTRIX_MOCK_LATENCY_SCALE``   multiplies every sampled latency (default 1.0)
``INQTRIX_MOCK_SELECT``          JSON: operation -> regex the reply must match

``INQTRIX_MOCK_SELECT`` exists because a captured corpus contains every shape a
step really produced, and some of those shapes change how much work the run
does at all: one classify answer decides against searching and collapses the
whole pipeline, and the evaluate answer's confidence decides whether a second
round happens. Replaying that distribution faithfully is right when measuring
capacity under representative load, and wrong when comparing two configurations,
where run depth must be held constant so the difference is attributable. The
selector makes that choice explicit and reports it, rather than leaving run
depth to chance.
