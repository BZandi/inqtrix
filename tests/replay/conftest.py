"""VCR + Stubber test configuration shared by every replay test module.

Centralises:

* The pytest-recording ``vcr_config`` session fixture (cassette format,
  record-mode resolution from ``INQTRIX_RECORD_MODE`` env, sanitization
  hooks).
* An ``autouse`` fixture that patches ``time.sleep`` to no-op for the
  duration of each replay test, so retry-loops in providers do not turn
  the suite into a 30-second wait.
* An ``autouse`` env-isolation fixture that strips provider-related
  ``*_API_KEY`` / ``*_ENDPOINT`` variables before every test, preventing
  a developer's local ``.env`` from accidentally turning a replay test
  into a live call.

Recording workflow (Maintainer-Tool, no separate pytest-marker, see
ADR-I in ``.cursor/memory/architecture-decisions.md``):

::

    INQTRIX_RECORD_MODE=once \\
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \\
      uv run pytest tests/replay/test_anthropic_replay.py::test_complete_success_replay -v

VCR will execute one real HTTP call, run the request/response through
the sanitization hooks, and write a YAML cassette to
``tests/fixtures/cassettes/anthropic/test_complete_success_replay.yaml``.
On every subsequent run (default ``INQTRIX_RECORD_MODE`` unset →
``record_mode="none"``) the cassette is replayed offline.
