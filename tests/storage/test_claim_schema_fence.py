"""The cutover fence rides inside every durable-claim transaction.

Four stores implement the durable claim separately; a fence on only one
leaves three doors open. The fence must also be the FIRST statement of the
transaction -- which these tests pin without any domain seeding: even a
claim for a MISSING id must hit the fence before it can answer ``None``,
because the fence runs before the row lookup.

What this deliberately does NOT cover (the documented limit): a migration
still in flight carries the old revision until its step commits; stopping
that needs the canonical migration workflow, not this check.
