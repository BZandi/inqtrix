"""P12: stock prompt templates seed once per scoped user, lazily.

The listing route is the chokepoint (every auth mode passes it right
after login because the client hydrates templates on app start). The
pinned contract: exactly one seeding per user ever — a deleted default
stays deleted, a grown library is never injected into, concurrent or
repeated listings cannot double-seed, and unscoped deployments never
seed. Plus the drift guard: the server module's four bodies stay
byte-identical to the demo rule files they were generated from.
