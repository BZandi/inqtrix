"""The blocking-work lanes must not be able to starve one another.

Long AI calls, event-stream readers and short reads have nothing in common
except that they block a thread. Sharing one pool lets the longest of them
decide whether the others get served at all: enough concurrent AI calls and an
event stream stops delivering, or a metrics scrape stops answering, while the
event loop sits idle.

These tests pin the separation itself, not an implementation detail — they
saturate one lane and require the others to stay responsive.
