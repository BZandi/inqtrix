"""The knowledge scope a delegated child is submitted with.

A child is not admitted through the HTTP router, so the submission-time
collection pin never ran for it — and a missing pin fails closed to an
EMPTY boundary. Every delegated mission therefore executed with no
knowledge at all while its surface reported knowledge as available: it
saw zero collections, asked the user for access it already had, or
answered from nothing.
