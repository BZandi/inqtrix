"""Unscoped knowledge asks pin retrieval to the caller-visible set.

The complement to ``test_knowledge_ownership``: those tests pin the
EXPLICIT ask gate (a named invisible collection denies the whole
request). Here we pin the UNSCOPED gate — an omitted, ``null``, or
empty ``collection_ids`` filter. Before the fix such an ask reached the
``mode=knowledge`` algorithm as ``None`` and :func:`retrieve` ranged
over EVERY collection in the tenant, so an authenticated stranger could
pull chunks from private collections into their answer. The admission
now resolves the scope to the caller-visible set
(:meth:`KnowledgeService.resolve_ask_scope`) on both ask surfaces
(chat + native runs).

The world is the oidc container over the memory knowledge store, with
an owner and a stranger. The leak is asserted end-to-end: the owner's
private document must never surface in the stranger's native-run
references, and its text must never reach the stranger's chat answer
prompt. ``visible_to=None`` (auth off) keeps the historical
see-everything view — pinned in the anonymous world at the bottom.
