"""The generation-gated frame authorization shared by both SSE twins.

The gate's contract: the FULL authoritative chain runs on the first
frame, whenever the commit-ordered generation moved, whenever the time
ceiling elapsed, and on every frame for principals without a generation
— never less. The generation is a hint; the chain decides.
