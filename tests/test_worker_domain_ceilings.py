"""Each worker loop runs at the LOWER of two ceilings, and says when it does.

``INQTRIX_WORKER_CONCURRENCY`` sizes the research loop, whose threads spend
their time waiting on providers. The other loops spend real CPU — an upload
extracts text from the file itself — so a worker sized for provider
parallelism would run that many extractions at once on a CPU-limited pod.
Deletion already had its own ceiling; indexing and upload now follow the
same rule, and a ceiling that binds is logged rather than left to be
inferred from throughput.
