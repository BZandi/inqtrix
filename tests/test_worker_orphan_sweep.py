"""Orphan-sweep gating of the durable job stores.

Locks the second root cause behind the failed Agent-Desk run: the
QUEUE-BACKED worker also constructs its stores with ``queue=None``
(claim-mode wiring). The run queue additionally enters the store through the
separate ``dispatch_queue`` seam for child submissions and parent wakes, so
the historical ``queue is None`` inference made every worker
start blanket-fail all queued/running runs of the deployment
("Verwaister Run ... nach Neustart als fehlgeschlagen markiert").
