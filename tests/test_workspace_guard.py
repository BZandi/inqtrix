"""Edge-case matrix for the UI-namespace delete guard (deny_cross_workspace).

The guard backs the M6 cross-project data-loss defense-in-depth: it denies a
delete whose request workspace differs from the resource's, but stays permissive
at the None edges so legacy/anonymous flows and workspace-less resources are
never blocked. These are the exact branch decisions; each would flip if someone
loosened or over-tightened the condition.
